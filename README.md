# CPSC_354 Class Project: "BitFielder" Domain-Specific Language

Group Members: Peter Smith

This project is a DSL intended to streamline the process of implementing memory-efficient integer ID systems in C++ by way of bit fields. Directly implementing them in C++ is tedious and prone to typos or mistakes.

A Python program will parse the BitFielder input and compile it to C++. This DSL is not interpreted.
